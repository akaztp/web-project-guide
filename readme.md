#Web Project Guide

##Welcome

Welcome to the Web Project Guide.

A full-fledged web project is a vast collection of different aspects, options, features and best practices that correlates web design, user experience design, programming logic, networking, quality and security. And probably some more that I'm forgetting. That's why this project exists.

This guide pretends to be a comprehensive list of aspects to consider when developing a web project but not to go deep into explanations and details. There is lot of information about each aspect in the internet.

Think of this guide as a list of things you have to take care or option to when developing a web project.

Also, this guide is a work in progress and, I guess, it will always be.
